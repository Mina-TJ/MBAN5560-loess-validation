# MBAN5560-loess-validation
LOESS hyperparameter tuning and validation methods (train-test split, cross-validation, bootstrap) for MBAN 5560 coursework.

# LOESS Validation and Model Selection

This repository contains my coursework for **MBAN 5560 (Machine Learning)** at **Saint Mary’s University**.  
The project focuses on tuning LOESS models and comparing different validation approaches.

## Objectives
- Explore bias–variance trade-offs in LOESS smoothing
- Evaluate model performance using different validation strategies
- Select hyperparameters based on out-of-sample performance

## Methods Covered
- Simple train–test split
- 10-fold cross-validation (nested tuning)
- Bootstrap validation
- Benchmark comparison (linear, polynomial, LOESS)

## Files
- `A1_student.qmd` – Source file containing analysis, code, and explanations  
- `A1_student.html` – Rendered output for easy viewing (optional)

## Tools
R, tidyverse, ggplot2, knitr
